This project focuses on classifying IRIS flowers using machine learning techniques implemented in Python with Scikit-Learn. It utilizes supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, along with metrics for performance evaluation and train-test split for validation. The well-known IRIS dataset, consisting of 150 samples categorized into three flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width, is used for training and testing the models. The project involves data preprocessing, applying different machine learning models, evaluating performance through accuracy and other metrics, and visualizing results for better understanding. It is designed to be beginner-friendly, making it an excellent learning resource for students and researchers in machine learning. To set up the project, install Python along with necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. The models' accuracy and effectiveness are assessed, helping to determine the best-performing approach for classification tasks.
