Dataset
IRIS Dataset (contains 150 samples with 3 classes of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
Features include Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
Installation and Setup
Install Python (if not already installed).
Install required libraries using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Clone or download this repository.
Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to train and test the models.
Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess it.
Apply different machine learning algorithms.
Evaluate the performance of each model.
Visualize results for better understanding.
Results and Accuracy
The models are evaluated based on accuracy and performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
The best-performing model can be chosen for classification tasks.
